  - A minimal React interface.
  - A lot like just using Hiccup + atoms

* lein-figwheel
  - https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel
  - Builds cljs code and hot loads into your browser.
  - Live reloads your css as well.
  - Extremely quick feedback cycles.

* Firebase: https://www.firebase.com/
   - "A powerful API to store and
     sync data in real time."
   - a NoSQL database hosted in the cloud.
   - Persistent connection between
     client and server.
   - Can host the html/javascript/css
     entirely using Firebase.

* Firebase: https://www.firebase.com/pricing.html
  - Free level is enough to at
    least get started with the service.
  - 50 concurrent connections, 5 GB transfer,
    100 MB storage

* Firebase: Data
  - You are manipulating a JSON object.

  | update      | Update some keys       |
  | push        | Add to a list of data  |
  | transaction | sort of like swap!     |

* Firebase: Retrieving Data
  - Subscribe to events
    - child_changed
    - child_added
    - child_removed
    - child_moved
    - value
  - Can also just get data once.

  - I use a minimal amount of it.
